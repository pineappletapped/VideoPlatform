# VideoPlatform

This project is a web app for managing live graphics, video and music playback. Everything lives under `wwwroot` so it can run from nearly any host that can execute PHP.

Uploaded media is stored on the server under `wwwroot/uploads` while metadata lives in Firebase Realtime Database.

## Running locally

Use PHP's builtâ€‘in server:

```bash
php -S localhost:8080 -t wwwroot
```

Make sure the `wwwroot/uploads` directory exists and is writable (e.g. `chmod 777 wwwroot/uploads`). Then open `http://localhost:8080/control.html?event_id=demo` in your browser.
